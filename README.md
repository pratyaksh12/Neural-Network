-nn.py consistes of the strure for building a neural network

-Value.py consists of a Value class that implements a fundamental building block for automatic differentiation in a computational graph. It's designed to perform operations (like addition, multiplication, and others) on scalar values while keeping track of the derivatives (gradients) using the backpropagation algorithm.
